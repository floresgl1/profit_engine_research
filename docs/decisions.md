# Design decisions

Every choice that shapes the system, with the alternatives and why. Entries
marked **(yours)** were decided by you; the rest were made during the
autonomous build and are open for you to overturn.

## Settled with you

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language **(yours)** | Python 3.11+ | `decimal` in stdlib, pandas for scoring, official SDKs exist (but see "SDK vs raw HTTP"). |
| Env/deps **(yours)** | uv with lockfile | Reproducible environments. |
| Core types **(yours)** | Frozen dataclasses, validation in `__post_init__` | No dependency in `core/`, every check is readable code. |
| Book orientation | Always the YES book, both sides best first | One book covers buying and selling both outcomes; walking is a loop from index 0. |
| Venue conversion **(yours)** | In the adapter | The fill engine never learns venue quirks (e.g. Kalshi NO bids -> YES asks). |
| Bad snapshots **(yours)** | `InvalidOrderBook` (a `ValueError`) for venue-data problems; ingest logs and skips only those; alert on high skip rate | Bugs in our own code raise `TypeError`/plain `ValueError` and stop the loop. |

## Fees

**Formula.** Both venues charge takers `rate * C * p * (1 - p)` per fill.
`FeeSchedule` holds `rate` plus the venue's rounding rules.

- **Kalshi**: `rate = 0.07 * fee_multiplier` for every `quadratic*` series
  fee type (the `_with_maker_fees` variants only add maker fees, and the paper
  engine only takes). Confirmed against Kalshi's own fee-rounding worked
  example (0.07 * 1 * 0.055 * 0.945 = 0.00363825). Per-fill fee is ceil'd to
  $0.000001; the order's cash change is then rounded against the trader to
  $0.0001 (direct member balance precision). Event-level fee overrides are
  applied when present.
- **Kalshi `flat` fee type**: not modeled. The official fee schedule PDF
  (`kalshi.com/docs/kalshi-fee-schedule.pdf`) returned HTTP 429 to every
  fetch, so the flat table is unknown. Those markets get `fee_schedule=None`
  and the paper engine refuses to trade them.
- **Polymarket**: per-market `feeSchedule.rate` from Gamma, fee rounded to 5
  dp, makers free. Only `exponent == 1` is modeled; the docs say the exponent
  applies to "the price component" without giving the exact formula, so any
  other exponent gets `fee_schedule=None` instead of a guess.
- **Unknown fees never mean zero fees.** A market without a schedule is not
  traded.

**Alternative considered:** per-venue fee classes. Rejected because the two
formulas differ only in rounding; one parameterized type is easier to test
and to store.
